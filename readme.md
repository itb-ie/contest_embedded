# Let's begin:

1. I was born on Sept 24 1981. How old am I? Let *AGE* be the answer in years.
2. Using the answer from above, find the *AGE*th prime number. The first prime number is 2.<br>
Let *PRIME* be the answer. Sum all the digits of *PRIME* and add 3 to the result. Let *SUM_PRIME* be the results of this.
3. Here is a special recursive series in which the element on position N can be written as:<br>
E(n) = E(n-3) + E(n-2) + E(n-1).<br>
The first elements are E(1)=1, E(2)=2 and E(3)=3.<br>
Compute the *SUM_PRIME* element in this series. Let *SERIES* be the result
4. In the file generate.c there is a function called generate that resturs a binary search tree.<br>
Call this function with *SUM_PRIME*
Iterate over the right hand side of this tree that was generated and print the elements in descending order. <br>
